## Welcome!

We are so happy that you're here!

This blog is meant to teach you all about coding in the Processing IDE,
whether you are a novice, beginner, intermediate, or advanced programmer.
The Processing IDE is built on the Java programming language,
and it can be a great introduction to programming and Java for
anyone unfamilar with either.

```java
void setup() {
    size(500, 500);
    println("Hello, World!");
}

void draw() {
    fill(0, 175, 50);
    noStroke();
    ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 100, 100);
}
```

This is a live blog, and development is still ongoing.
Updates and new articles will be posted to [brittni's various social media accounts](https://linktr.ee/brittniwatkins).

***The applications of computer programming are numerous and varied; there is space for everyone.***

Happy Coding!
